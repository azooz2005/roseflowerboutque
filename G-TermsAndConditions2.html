    <div class="div">
        <p class="div-p">
            These terms (as well as all documents referred to herein) specify the Terms and Conditions
            (the “Terms”) which will apply when an order (‘Order’) is placed from the products (the “Products”)
            referred to on the Rose (‘Rose’, ‘Our’, ‘us’, ‘we’) website or mobile application(s) (iPhone or Android)
            (the “Platforms”). Please read these terms carefully before ordering any of our Products.
            <br>
            If you have any questions concerning these Terms, please contact us before placing any Order.
            <br>
            If you do not agree to these Terms, then you may not use the Platforms.
            <br>
            Rose reserves the right to modify these Terms from time to time, at its sole discretion, without prior
            notice.
            You agree that each visit you make to the Platforms shall be subject to the then-current Terms and
            Conditions and
            Privacy Policy if applicable and continued use of the Platforms following modifications of these Terms
            confirms that
            you have read, accepted, and agreed to be bound by such modifications.
            <br>
            If you do not accept the notified changes you may continue to use the Platforms and the Service in
            accordance
            with the existing terms, but certain new features may not be available to you.
            <br>
            In the event you are a consumer, your legal rights will apply in addition to these Terms but will not
            replace them,
            unless there is a contradiction and the consumer rights are mandatory, then the consumer rights will prevail
            and apply.
            <br>
            In all the countries in which we operate, and in addition to consumer rights, all laws and regulations
            relating
            to e-commerce and electronic transactions, as well as any specific laws to our industry, issued by any
            governmental authority,
            shall together with these Terms be applicable, unless a contradiction arises between these Terms and any
            mandatory law or
            regulation amongst the aforementioned laws and regulations. In such case, the mandatory law or regulation
            will prevail and apply.
            <br>
            By setting up a Rose Account, you confirm your acknowledgement and acceptance of these Terms.
            <br>
            You must be 18 or over to accept these terms and use the platforms or its related services.
