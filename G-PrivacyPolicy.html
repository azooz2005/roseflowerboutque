            an advertisement for our gift baskets.
            This kind of targeted advertising is sometimes called interest-based or online behavioral advertising. We do
            not control such third-party websites
            or services on which these advertisements appear.<br>
            We do not control how they collect and use data about your online activities. Any information that these

            Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data.
            This will extend to:<br>
        <section>The right to be informed:</section> You have the right to be provided with information about

        you with the information in this policy.<br>
        <section>The right of access:</section> You have the right to obtain access to your information. This
        will enable you, for example,
        to check that we’re using your information in accordance with data protection laws. If you wish to access
        the information we hold
        about you in this way, please get in touch with us (see Contact Us section).<br>
        <section>The right to rectification:</section> You are entitled to have your information corrected if
        it is inaccurate or incomplete.
        You can request that we rectify any errors in information that we hold by contacting us (see Contact Us
        section).<br>
        <section>The right to erasure:</section> This enables you to request the deletion or removal of

        <section>The right to withdraw consent:</section> If you have given your consent to anything we do
        with your information
        (i.e., we rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information), you have the right to withdraw
        that consent
        at any time. You can do this by contacting us (see Contact Us section). Withdrawing consent will not however
        make unlawful
        our use of your information while consent had been apparent.<br>
        <section>The right to Object to processing of your personal Data:</section> This enables you to ask
        us to suspend the processing of
        your personal data in the following scenarios:<br>
        a) If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.<br>
        b) Where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it.<br>
        c) Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise
        or defend legal claims.<br>
        d) You have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate
        grounds to use it.<br>
        <section>Request Transfer of your personal Data:</section> Transfer your personal data to you or to a
        third party. We will provide to you,
        or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
        format. Note that this right only applies
        to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information
        to perform a contract with you.<br>
        We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right
        to access your personal data
        (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not
        disclosed to any person who
        has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your
        request to speed up our response.<br>
        You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
        However, we may charge a
        reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse
        to comply with
        your request in these circumstances.<br>
        You may contact us when additional details are required about the specific legal ground we are relying on to
        process your personal data,
        we will be happy to respond to any request or feedback you send us through our communication channels.

            If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel
            that
            the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), you must immediately notify us of
            any
            unauthorized activity by contacting us via the email found in the "Contact Us" section available on all our
            platforms (note that if you choose to notify us via physical mail, it will take a longer duration of time
            for us to respond to the issue raised).<br>
            Portions of the goods and services we supply may require registration and log-in processes in which you will
